        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>I have always been a huge steak fan, but this is my go to recipe whenever I have guests 
                over for dinner. As much as I love a grilled steak, my favorite steak is a ribeye from Ruth's 
                Chris. Essentialy poached in butter, the steak will have a nice crust and a wonderful aroma from
                the rosemary. 
            </p>

            <p>It is a consistent, delicious recipe that is nearly foolproof. As long as you follow the directions
                precisely with a timer and use a flatiron pan, then you will have a perfect medium rare steak every time. I'm getting hungry just thinking 
                about it!
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>16oz Ribeye, cut about 1.5 inches thick</li>
                <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (or any high smoke point oil)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>salt and fresh-ground pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a flatiron pan over a medium high burner for about 10 minutes, so that it gets very hot.</li>
                <li>While the pan is heating, dry the outside of the Ribeye and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>After the pan is heated, put the cooking oil in the pan and allow to heat for about ten seconds.</li>
                <li>Place the steak in the pan and start your timer. You will now flip the steak every minute with a pair of tongs.</li>
                <li>After 4 minutes have elapsed, pick the steak up and place the butter in the pan, giving it about 30 seconds to melt.</li>
                <li>Place the steak back in the pan and place the rosemary to the sides of the steak. Continue to flip every minute for another 4 minutes</li>
                <li>Pull the steak out and place it on a paper towel. Tent with foil and allow it to rest for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>The steak is now ready to be enjoyed with your favorite sides! You might consider cooking some kale in the same pan with some lemon.</li>
            </ol>
