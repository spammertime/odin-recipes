            <ul>
                <li>1 cup flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
                <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>4 tbsp melted butter</li>
                <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the milk and vinegar in a bowl and allow the milk to "sour" for about 10 minutes while you combine the rest of the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Mix together all of the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and set to the side.</li>
                <li>After the milk has soured, mix in the rest of the wet ingredients.</li>
                <li>Slowly mix in the dry ingredients which will help to prevent lumps in the batter.</li>
                <li>Heat a flat cooktop to 400 degrees and spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Cook until you see bubbles start to pop on the top side. Flip and let cook for about 2 more minutes. Serve hot with butter and your favorite topping</li>

            </ol>
